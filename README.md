# VR Jam 2021

This is the git setup for the VR Game Jam 2021. Instructions on how to use:
# Download for the first time:
```bash
cd /path/where/you/want/the/project
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JuliusWon/VRJam2021.git
```
```bash
cd VRJam2021
```
# Update project
```bash
git pull
```
# Sync project
```bash 
git add .
```
```bash
git commit -a -m 'say what you did'
```
```bash 
git push
```
The following tutorial will also work and includes a GUI, but needs additional software and can at times be confusing (in my experience and opinion): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpXxcvS-g3g
